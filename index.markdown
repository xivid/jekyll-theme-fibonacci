    Hi, I&rsquo;m Triton. I was graduated as an Electronics Engineer way back in 2004. It's little late for me to know my destiny is written to play with code. I started my career in Software development 10 years back. I worked in numerous projects and got appreciation from many people. I spent most of the time in my career with Microsoft technology stack. Some of the frameworks I've good expertise with are: ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API and WCF.

    After I discovered the beauty of JavaScript I moved to front-end development. Nowadays I spend most of the time learning and experimenting frameworks like Backbone, RequireJs, AngularJs, Grunt and Node.
